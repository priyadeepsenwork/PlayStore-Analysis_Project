YouTube Music has played an essential role in the latter half of my life, and other than occasional frustration with the song recommendation algorithm, I think it's perfect. I just hope it doesn't choose to change everything and cram ""AI"" down our throats, the way other things have been doing. Keep practicing one kick 10,000 times instead of 10,000 kicks once, YouTube Music.","The free version is actually horrendous. Ads after every song/play of a song, if you get an ad, skip it and then select another song, it gives you another ad, most ads have a drop-down box with a link to their website that prevents you from swiping the 'currently listening' box down to pick a different song, said drop-down box doesn't close automatically if the ad ends or is skipped. The literal only good thing about the free version is that you can listen to music, everything else is terrible",MUSIC_AND_AUDIO,music and audio apps

Lumping these two kinds of notifications together without an option to toggle them is ignorant at best and manipulative at worst. I just need quick delivery updates, nothing else, and I don't need an app that can't or won't do just that.","The last two months, Amazon has been messing up orders left & right. Not sure what's going on, but they owe me some money for sending incorrect items in multiple orders. App design makes customer service on these issues ridiculously hard to find.
